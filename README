EM(1)

NAME
    em - editor for mortals (Unix v6-derived line editor)

SYNOPSIS
    em [-qeps] [file]

DESCRIPTION
    em is a line-oriented editor with a visual raw-line editing mode (the
    `o` command). It is based on the Unix v6 editor lineage and includes the
    historical QMC extensions (prompts, screen context, and the `o` command).

    The raw `o` editor uses control keys for in-line editing and supports a
    built-in help screen (command `h`) via the installed emhelp file.

OPTIONS
    -q  Restore default SIGHUP handling (do not ignore hangup).
    -e  "Elfic" mode: disables explicit write commands and auto-writes on quit.
    -p  Enable prompting.
    -s  Silent mode (no prompts).

    If the program name ends in 'm', prompts are enabled by default. Supplying
    a lone '-' also selects silent mode.

COMMANDS
    This editor is command-driven; use `h` for the built-in help screen. The
    `o` command opens a raw line editor for the current line or range. In `o`
    mode, typed characters echo immediately; `#` or `^X` deletes a character
    with a full-line redraw for visual feedback. Use `ESC` or `^D` to finish.

BUILD
    ./configure
    make

    This codebase targets C23. Configure probes for a C23-capable compiler flag.

    For a better interactive command-line experience, you can run em through
    rlwrap (if installed):
        rlwrap em

INSTALL
    make install

    Installs the editor and help file to the configured prefix. You may need
    elevated privileges (e.g., sudo) depending on the prefix.

DISTCHECK
    make distcheck

    Runs the full distribution build/test cycle used by packagers. Some docs
    refer to this as "makedistcheck", but the target is "distcheck".

FILES
    /tmp/exxxxx                temporary file for the edit buffer
    $(datadir)/em/emhelp       help text for the `h` command

HISTORY
    - Ken Thompson original editor
    - QMC modifications (Coulouris, 1976)
    - Modern POSIX/C99 port (2012)
    - C23 port and tooling updates (2025)

PORTERS
    - Prefer `make distcheck` before packaging.
    - Respect DESTDIR and prefix during install.
    - Help file installs to $(datadir)/em/emhelp.

BUGS
    Please report issues with a minimal reproducible example and environment
    details (OS, compiler version, and terminal).
