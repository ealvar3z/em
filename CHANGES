===============================
Per `doc/modernC.pdf`, the following concrete C23‑aligned recommendations for this codebase:

  - Use C23 attributes where they convey intent. C23's [[maybe_unused]] on
    parameters like argv. In this codebase, `onintr(int signo)` doesn’t use
`signo`, so `onintr([[maybe_unused]] int signo)` in `src/em1.c` would be a
clear, standard C23 annotation.
  - Keep the C23 “VLA argv” main signature (already done) to document the argc
    + 1 relationship, exactly as the book demonstrates.
  - Consider switching flag‑style globals from int to bool with true/false (now
    keywords in C23).  Candidates: elfic, vflag (maybe as tri‑state?), xflag,
pflag, listf. This improves readability and matches modern C idioms.
  - Add compile‑time invariants with static_assert (or constexpr where
    appropriate) for assumptions like buffer sizes (LBSIZE, ESIZE, NBRA),
improving self‑documentation.
  - Keep int for character input paths returning EOF (DONE: already fixed
    `getchr`). It’s a Modern C best practice to avoid truncation of EOF.

  Suggestions:

  1. Apply [[maybe_unused]] to unused parameters first (low risk).
  2. Convert simple flag globals to bool.
  3. Add static_assert for buffer size invariants.
